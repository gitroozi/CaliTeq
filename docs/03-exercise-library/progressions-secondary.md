### Safety Notes for Plyometrics

**Critical Requirements:**

- Soft landing mechanics (ball of foot first)
- Shock-absorbing surface (grass, rubber - NOT concrete)
- Volume limit: 40-60 contacts per session (beginners), max 100
- Frequency: 2x per week maximum, not consecutive days
- Step down from boxes, don't jump down

**Contraindications:**
- Joint issues (knee, ankle, hip)
- High body weight (excess impact stress)
- Poor landing mechanics
