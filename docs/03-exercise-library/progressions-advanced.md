- Skill work requires **daily practice** (5-15 minutes)
- Keep sessions short to avoid fatigue
- Practice when fresh (beginning of workout)
- Patience: Skills take months to years
- Wrist conditioning non-negotiable for hand-balancing
- Use crash pads/mats when learning new skills
- Video yourself to analyze form
- Consider coaching for advanced skills (muscle-ups, planches)
