## Overview {#overview}

The CaliFlow exercise library is organized around **22 distinct movement patterns** that comprehensively cover all human movement capabilities. This organization ensures:

- Balanced muscular development
- No movement gaps in programming
- Systematic progression tracking
- Injury prevention through comprehensive training
- Clear exercise selection for workout generation

## Primary Movement Patterns (7 patterns) {#primary-patterns}

These fundamental patterns form the foundation of all strength programs.

### 1. Horizontal Push

**Target Muscles:** Chest (pectoralis major), anterior deltoids, triceps

**Primary Exercises:**
- Push-up variations (wall → incline → standard → diamond → one-arm)
- Dip variations (bench → parallel bar → weighted → ring)

**Function:** Pushing objects away from the body at chest level; essential for daily activities like opening doors, pushing shopping carts

**Training Frequency:** 2-4x per week

---

### 2. Vertical Push

**Target Muscles:** Shoulders (deltoids), upper chest, triceps, upper trapezius

**Primary Exercises:**
- Pike push-up progressions
- Handstand push-up progressions
- Overhead press variations (with external load)

**Function:** Pressing objects overhead; reaching high shelves, lifting objects overhead

**Training Frequency:** 1-3x per week

**Special Consideration:** High shoulder stress; requires excellent mobility and scapular stability

---

### 3. Horizontal Pull

**Target Muscles:** Mid-back (rhomboids, mid trapezius), rear deltoids, biceps

**Primary Exercises:**
- Row variations (doorway → bent-knee → straight-leg → feet-elevated → weighted)
- Front lever progressions (advanced)

**Function:** Pulling objects toward the body; opening doors, pulling rope, maintaining posture

**Training Frequency:** 2-4x per week

**Importance:** Critical for shoulder health and posture correction (counterbalances pushing movements)

---

### 4. Vertical Pull

**Target Muscles:** Latissimus dorsi, biceps, mid-back, rear deltoids

**Primary Exercises:**
- Pull-up/chin-up variations (assisted → negative → full → weighted → one-arm)
- Back lever progressions

**Function:** Pulling body upward or objects downward; climbing, lifting body weight

**Training Frequency:** 2-4x per week

**Milestone Exercise:** Often the most sought-after achievement for beginners

---

### 5. Squat

**Target Muscles:** Quadriceps, glutes, adductors, core stabilizers

**Primary Exercises:**
- Bilateral squats (assisted → box → bodyweight → tempo → jump)
- Unilateral squats (split → Bulgarian split → pistol)

**Function:** Sitting, standing, climbing stairs, jumping

**Training Frequency:** 2-3x per week

**Essential For:** Lower body strength, bone density, metabolic health

---

### 6. Hinge

**Target Muscles:** Hamstrings, glutes, erector spinae, adductors

**Primary Exercises:**
- Hip hinge drills
- Glute bridges and hip thrusts
- Nordic curl progressions
- Single-leg Romanian deadlifts

**Function:** Bending at hips to pick up objects, posterior chain strength

**Training Frequency:** 2-3x per week

**Critical For:** Lower back health, athletic performance, injury prevention

---

### 7. Core Stability

**Target Muscles:** Rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, obliques, erector spinae

**Primary Exercises:**
- Anti-extension (planks, hollow body holds)
- Anti-lateral flexion (side planks)
- Anti-rotation (dead bugs, bird dogs, Pallof press)

**Function:** Spinal stability during all movements; transferring force between upper and lower body

**Training Frequency:** 3-6x per week

**Foundation:** Strong core enables safe progression in all other movement patterns

---

## Secondary Movement Patterns (6 patterns) {#secondary-patterns}

### 8. Anti-Rotation

**Purpose:** Resist rotational forces; protect spine during unilateral movements

**Key Exercises:** Pallof press, suitcase carries, Copenhagen planks

**Training Frequency:** 2-3x per week

---

### 9. Rotation

**Purpose:** Generate rotational power; improve athletic performance

**Key Exercises:** Woodchops, medicine ball throws, Russian twists

**Training Frequency:** 1-2x per week

**Sport-Specific:** Essential for throwing, swinging, striking movements

---

### 10. Locomotion

**Purpose:** Full-body coordination, conditioning, movement quality

**Key Exercises:** Bear crawls, crab walks, duck walks, leopard crawls

**Training Frequency:** 2-3x per week (often used in warm-ups)

**Benefits:** Shoulder stability, core strength, coordination, fun variation

---

### 11. Jumping/Plyometrics

**Purpose:** Power development, bone density, athletic performance

**Key Exercises:** Jump rope, box jumps, squat jumps, broad jumps

**Training Frequency:** 1-2x per week maximum

**Caution:** High impact; requires strength base and proper landing mechanics

---

### 12. Ballistic Movements

**Purpose:** Explosive power, rate of force development

**Key Exercises:** Clap push-ups, explosive pull-ups, medicine ball throws

**Training Frequency:** 1-2x per week

**Advanced:** Requires mastery of standard variations first

---

### 13. Loaded Carries

**Purpose:** Core stability under load, grip strength, conditioning

**Key Exercises:** Farmer carries, suitcase carries, overhead carries

**Training Frequency:** 1-2x per week

**Note:** Requires external weight (dumbbells, kettlebells, weighted vest)

---

## Skill-Based Movement Patterns (4 patterns) {#skill-patterns}

### 14. Static Holds (L-sits, V-sits, Planche, Levers)

**Purpose:** Advanced strength demonstration; impressive skills

**Prerequisites:** 6-12 months of consistent training minimum

**Training Frequency:** Daily practice (5-15 minutes)

**Difficulty Range:** 6-10

---

### 15. Handstands/Inversions

**Purpose:** Balance, shoulder strength, body awareness

**Prerequisites:** Good wrist conditioning, shoulder mobility

**Training Frequency:** Daily practice recommended

**Safety:** Learn to bail safely; use wall for initial progressions

---

### 16. Dynamic Skills (Muscle-ups, 360 pulls)

**Purpose:** Combination movements; strength + coordination

**Prerequisites:** 10+ pull-ups, 10+ dips (for muscle-ups)

**Milestone:** Muscle-up is a major achievement for most trainees

---

### 17. Flow & Combination Movements

**Purpose:** Creative expression, movement fluidity, fun

**Examples:** Linking burpees → pull-ups → muscle-ups; handstand flows

**Training Frequency:** As desired (often end of training sessions)

**Benefits:** Keeps training engaging, improves movement quality

---

## Auxiliary Movement Patterns (4 patterns) {#auxiliary-patterns}

### 18. Mobility & Flexibility

**Purpose:** Joint health, injury prevention, movement quality

**Key Work:** Dynamic stretching (warm-up), static stretching (cool-down), bridge progressions

**Training Frequency:** Daily (10-15 minutes minimum)

**Critical:** Enables safe progression in all other patterns

---

### 19. Stability & Balance

**Purpose:** Proprioception, injury prevention, functional fitness

**Key Exercises:** Single-leg stands, single-leg Romanian deadlifts, balance challenges

**Training Frequency:** 2-3x per week

**Benefits:** Reduces fall risk, improves sports performance

---

### 20. Grip Strength

**Purpose:** Enables pulling exercises; functional strength

**Key Exercises:** Dead hangs, towel hangs, farmer carries

**Training Frequency:** 2-3x per week

**Often:** Limiting factor in pull-up progressions

---

### 21. Wrist & Forearm Conditioning

**Purpose:** Enables handstand work, planche training, injury prevention

**Key Exercises:** Wrist circles, wrist push-ups, reverse wrist curls

**Training Frequency:** Daily (especially before handstand/planche work)

**Essential:** Before any advanced pushing skills

---

## Programming Guidelines {#programming-guidelines}

**Focus:** Primary movement patterns only (patterns 1-7)

**Weekly Structure:**
- 3 full-body sessions per week
- Include all 7 primary patterns each session OR alternate patterns across sessions
- Volume: 2-3 sets per pattern
- Add locomotion to warm-ups (pattern 10)

**Sample Full-Body Session:**
1. Warm-up: Bear crawls, joint rotations
2. Horizontal Push: Push-ups
3. Horizontal Pull: Inverted rows
4. Squat: Bodyweight squats
5. Hinge: Glute bridges
6. Core: Planks + dead bugs
7. Cool-down: Static stretching

---

### Intermediate Programs (6-18 months)

**Add:** Secondary patterns (8-13) as training capacity increases

**Weekly Structure:**
- 4 sessions per week (upper/lower split OR full-body)
- Include plyometrics and ballistic work (1-2x weekly)
- Begin skill work if interested (handstands, L-sits)

---

### Advanced Programs (18+ months)

**Full Pattern Integration:**
- All 22 patterns utilized across weekly training
- Skill work daily (handstands, levers, planche progressions)
- Periodized training with specific focus blocks
