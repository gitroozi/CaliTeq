**Key Progression Principles:**

1. **Master current level** before progressing (3x12-15 reps with good form)
2. **Linear progression** for beginners (add reps/sets weekly)
3. **Wave progression** for intermediates (cycle through rep ranges)
4. **Multiple paths available** at intermediate+ levels
5. **Deload every 3-4 weeks** (reduce volume 40-50%)
6. **Form over progression** - never sacrifice technique for harder variations
